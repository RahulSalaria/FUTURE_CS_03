# Network Port Scan - Task 1

## Objective
Perform network reconnaissance on local hosts to identify open ports and understand potential security risks.

## Tools Used
- **Nmap** – for scanning hosts and discovering open ports
- **Wireshark** – for analyzing packet captures (SYN/SYN-ACK handshake)
- **PowerShell** – to run Nmap scans and save results

## Steps Taken
1. Installed Nmap and identified the local IP range.
2. Performed a TCP SYN scan using Nmap:  
3. Recorded open ports and host IPs from Nmap output.
4. Captured packet data in Wireshark to verify open ports using SYN → SYN/ACK handshake.
5. Noted the common services running on each open port.
6. Assessed potential security risks associated with each open port.
